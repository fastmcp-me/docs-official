For organizations requiring role-based access control (RBAC), Galileo supports fine-grained control over granting users different levels of access to the system, as well as organizing users into groups for easily sharing projects. Some features are only available to customers on paid Galileo plans.

## System-level Roles

There are four roles that a user can be assigned:

- **Admin** - Full access to the organization, including viewing all projects.
- **Manager** (enterprise only) - Can add and remove users.
- **User** - Can create, update, share, and delete projects and resources within projects.
- **Read-only** - Cannot create, update, share, or delete any projects or resources. Limited to view-only permissions.

_Note:_ Free users of Galileo can only use the Admin, User, or Read-only roles. [Contact us](https://galileo.ai/contact-sales) to explore a paid plan and get full RBAC.

System-level roles are chosen when users are invited to Galileo:

## Groups (enterprise only)

Users can be organized into groups to streamline sharing projects. Currently, groups are only available to customers on paid plans of Galileo.

There are 3 types of groups:

- **Public** - Group and members are visible to everyone in the organization. Anyone can join.
- **Private** - Group is visible to everyone in the organization. Members are kept private. Access is granted by a group maintainer.
- **Hidden** - Group and its members are hidden from non-members in the organization. Access is granted by a group maintainer.

Within a group, each member has a group role:

- **Maintainer** - Can add and remove members.
- **Member** - Can view other members and shared projects.

## Share Projects

By default, only a project's creator (and managers and admins) have access to a project. Projects can be shared both with individual users and entire groups. Together, these are called _collaborators_.

How to share a project with collaborators:
