title: Annotations Overview
---

**Annotations** allow users to provide human feedback on LLM inputs and outputs through the Galileo Console UI and the [API](https://v2galileo-fix-annotations.mintlify.app/api-reference/annotation/create-annotation-template).

Currently, Galileo supports annotations on Traces.  

For each project, users with the necessary permissions can configure one or more of these annotation types:

- **Categories**: Enable annotators to select one or more designated categories
- **Score**: Enable annotators to select a number between 0 and a max score
- **Star**: Enable annotators to rate from 1 to 5 stars
- **Text**: Enable annotators to provide freeform text
- **Thumbs Up & Down**: Enable annotators to rate a like or dislike

The following roles have permissions to configure annotations: organization admins, project owners, or project editors.

The minimum permissions for creating annotations are: organization users, and project annotators. Read-only or viewer roles cannot submit annotations.

Galileo's Annotations feature is being actively improved. Please bookmark this page or contact <a href="mailto:support\@galileo.ai">support\@galileo.ai</a> to send requests and suggestions.
