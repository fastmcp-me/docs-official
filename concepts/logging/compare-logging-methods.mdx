## Introduction

When building a Generative AI application, it is crucial to understand its behavior: what data is processed, where errors occur, and how long responses take. Galileo solves this by providing OpenAI ([Python](/sdk-api/python/wrappers/openai), [TypeScript](/sdk-api/typescript/wrappers/openai)) and LangChain ([Python](/sdk-api/python/wrappers/langchain)) wrappers, which help you generate application traces with minimal set up.

However, when you need more control over the logging process, the Galileo SDK offers a few other solutions:

- `galileo_context` for simple, session-based logging
- `GalileoLogger` class for flexible control
- `@log` decorator (or `log` function wrapper) for granular, function-level logging

This guide compares these approaches and offers guidance on when to use each one. If you're in a hurry, you can jump right to the [summary here](#when-to-use-each-method).


## `galileo_context`

The Galileo Context manager provides a way to control logging for a block of code. It allows you to start logging quickly while handling details like creating traces or saving events to the Galileo Console for you. You can use it to access your project's logger instance. 

### Example

Galileo Context manager can be used to access a managed `GalileoLogger` instance, so that you can add custom traces and spans based on your application's flow. 

<CodeGroup>
  <ContextLoggerPython />
  <ContextLoggerTypeScript />
</CodeGroup>

### When to use `galileo_context`

The Galileo Context manager is great when your logic is contained in a single block of code, or you want to quickly get started logging. It is also ideal for experimenting in Python Notebooks (e.g. Jupyter). 


## `GalileoLogger`

The `GalileoLogger` class gives you more flexible control over logging. You can decide when your logging session starts or ends, and create spans and traces manually. You get a lot more control over the data you can send to Galileo Console, including the ability to tag and add custom metadata to your spans. 

`GalileoLogger` is available in both the 
[Python](/sdk-api/python/logging/galileo-logger) and [TypeScript](/sdk-api/typescript/logging/galileo-logger) SDKs. It supports multiple span types (LLM, retriever, tool, workflow, agent), in addition to [logging session management](/concepts/logging/sessions/using-sessions#steps). 

### Example

The example below shows how to 

1. Create a `GalileoLogger` instance
1. Manually create a `Trace` for your application events
1. Add `Spans` to the Trace, and 
1. Both conclude and flush the logs. 

Although the steps are shown in sequence here, you can perform each wherever it makes sense to do so in your app: just create the `logger` instance and pass its reference to anywhere you want to create traces and spans.

  <SnippetTSGalileoLogger />
</CodeGroup>

### When to use `GalileoLogger`

This approach is ideal for complex applications that require fine-grained logging control, or where your app logic is spread around different functions. 


## `@log` decorator or `log` function wrapper

The `@log` decorator ([Python](/sdk-api/python/logging/log-decorator)) or `log` function wrapper ([TypeScript](/sdk-api/typescript/logging/log-function-wrapper)) is the most granular approach to capturing events in your application. Use it to capture the inputs and outputs of individual function calls&mdash;even generator functions!&mdash;as [spans](/concepts/logging/spans).

You can decorate or wrap any function you want to log, and specify the type of Span you want to create. The `@log` decorator supports different Span types: if there is no current trace when your function runs, `log` will generate a single-span trace.

### Example

The example below shows how to create different types of spans with the `log` decorator or function wrapper (depending on your SDK). Calling the decorated or wrapped function will generate the corresponding Span in your log stream.

<CodeGroup>
  <LogDecoratorPy />
  <LogDecoratorTs />
</CodeGroup>

### When to use `log`

This approach is ideal for creating spans to log an LLM response, tool usage, or some other helper function. If your log context does not have a Trace, calling a `log`-decorated function will create a single-span Trace. Otherwise, the span will be added to the current context. `log` is best used on functions that represent meaningful work units in your app.

Note that, if your application has a lot of units to be manually logged, this approach may require a little more work than the others. In such cases, consider combining it with other methods that automatically generate traces, such as `galileo_context` or a `GalileoLogger` instance.

## When to Use Each Method

| Method             | Use When...                                                                                                          |
|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `galileo_context`  | You are using the Python SDK, want to log events with minimal code, and your logic is in a single block              |
| `GalileoLogger`    | You need more flexible control over your logging session, and/or your application logic depends on more than one file |
| `@log` decorator   | You want to capture individual function calls within your logging session, and/or combine them into custom workflows |

## Conclusion

Each Galileo logging method helps you capture your application's activity, but the right choice depends on your needs:

- Use `galileo_context` to log a block of code with minimal setup
- Use `GalileoLogger` when you need to control when logging begins/ends, and what is sent to the Galileo Console
- Use `@log` to track individual function calls, so that you can see their inputs and outputs 

You can also combine these methods for even more flexibility.
