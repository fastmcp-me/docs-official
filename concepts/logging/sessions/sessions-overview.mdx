<DefinitionCard>
A Session is **a collection of Traces, Events, and Spans emitted by your Application**. They group all Traces for one conversation or evaluation run, giving you a bird's-eye view of that LLM workflow.

## Introduction

Imagine you're building a simple LLM-powered customer service chat application. In testing it, you might want to see how a single multi-turn conversation flows from user prompt to tool calling to model response. **Sessions** solve this problem by bundling low-level events into a cohesive unit, so you can trace an entire LLM interaction from start to finish.


## Core Concepts

Let's take a look at the building blocks of a session.

### Span → Trace → Session
- [**Span**](/concepts/logging/spans): The smallest logging unit the system, typically representing a single operation, function call, or request. Each user message, model API call, or model tool usage generates a *Span*.  
- [**Trace**](/concepts/logging/traces): When multiple spans occur as part of a single logical operation (e.g. a request that triggers several downstream calls) they form a *Trace*. Traces allow you to see parent/child relationships among spans.  
- **Session**: A collection of one or more traces that together represent an entire experiment, interaction, or multi-step evaluation. A Session bundles related traces so that you can analyze an entire workflow end to end, even if it spans multiple services, threads, or agents.


## How do Sessions differ from Log Streams?

A [**Log Stream**](/concepts/logging/logstreams) is a continuous sequence of log entries emitted over time. Log Streams simply capture everything in chronological order, and can contain a mix of spans, traces, and sessions. 

On the other hand, a *Session* is a way to group Traces that are logically connected. And with Galileo, every Session is stored in a Log Stream that you can specify either explicitly or using environment variables.

<Note>
You can use **Sessions** to segment a log stream into coherent experiments or runs, making it easier to analyze end-to-end behavior.

## How do Sessions differ from Workflows?
A **Workflow** is a defined sequence of steps or tasks. It may include branching logic, conditional steps, and dependencies.  

A *Session* can contain one or more *Workflows* if they are part of the same overall experiment or evaluation.


## Where can I find my sessions?

Sessions can be viewed in the [Galileo Console](/concepts/logging/sessions/using-sessions#view-your-session). When you create a session, you will usually select a Log Stream where they will be found. (If you don't specify one, Galileo will use your default log stream). 

You can view them in a few easy steps:

## Conclusion

A Session can collect multiple workflow runs and traces into one cohesive view. By using Sessions in your LLM application, you can:  
1. Organize logs and metrics for each customer interaction or batch evaluation run, so debugging and analysis become straightforward.
2. Drill down into any step—inspect the span for tokenization latency or the trace for scoring logic—without losing context.  
3. Easily compare multiple chat sessions to track performance improvements.
