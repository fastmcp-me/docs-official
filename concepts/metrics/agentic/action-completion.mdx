<DefinitionCard>
  <strong>Action Completion</strong> determines whether the assistant successfully accomplished all of the user's goals.
</DefinitionCard>

To accomplish a user's goal, the assistant must:

- Provide a complete answer in the case of a question.
- Provide a confirmation of successful action in the case of a request.

Additionally, the response must:
- Be coherent and factually accurate.
- Comprehensively address every aspect of the user's request.
- Avoid contradicting tool outputs.
- Summarize all relevant parts returned by tools.

## Calculation Method

If the response does not achieve an Action Completion score of 100%, it indicates that at least one judge considered the model to have failed in accomplishing every user goal.

Action Completion is calculated by:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Additional Requests">
    Multiple requests are sent to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT4o) using a carefully designed chain-of-thought prompt that adheres to the definition above.

</Step>
  <Step title="Judgment Responses">
    The LLM generates multiple distinct responses, each containing:
    - An explanation.
    A final judgment: "Yes" (goal accomplished) or "No" (goal not accomplished).

</Step>
  <Step title="Score Computation">
    Action Completion Score = (Number of "Yes" Responses) / (Total Number of Responses)

</Step>
  <Step title="Explanation Surfacing">
    One explanation is surfaced, chosen to align with the majority judgment among the responses.
</Step>
</Steps>

We display one of the generated explanations alongside the score, always choosing one that aligns with the majority judgment.

<Note>
This metric requires multiple LLM calls to compute, which may impact usage and billing.

  </div>

The **Action Completion** metric is particularly valuable in the following scenarios:

- **Agentic Workflows**: When an AI agent must decide on a course of action and select tools to accomplish tasks.
- **Multi-step Tasks**: When completing a user's request requires multiple steps or decisions.
- **Tool-using Assistants**: When evaluating if the assistant used available tools effectively.

This metric helps determine whether the assistant chose appropriate actions and made meaningful progress toward fulfilling the user's request.

## Best Practices

To optimize your assistant's performance and ensure high Action Completion scores, consider the following best practices:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Track Progress Over Time" icon="chart-line">
    Monitor Action Completion scores across different versions of your agent to identify trends and ensure continuous improvements in task completion capabilities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Analyze Failure Patterns" icon="magnifying-glass">
    When Action Completion scores are low, examine specific steps or scenarios where agents fail to meet user goals. Use this analysis to identify and address systematic issues.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Combine with Other Metrics" icon="scale-balanced">
    Use Action Completion alongside other agentic metrics, such as Action Advancement, to get a comprehensive view of your assistant's effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Edge Cases" icon="code-branch">
    Create evaluation datasets that include complex, multi-step tasks to thoroughly assess your agent's ability to handle challenging scenarios and advance user goals effectively.
  </Card>

<Note>
When optimizing for Action Completion, ensure you're not sacrificing other important aspects like safety, factual accuracy, or user experience in pursuit of task completion.
