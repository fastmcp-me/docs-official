<DefinitionCard>
<strong>Agent Efficiency</strong> is a binary evaluation metric of the efficiency of your agentic workflows.
</DefinitionCard>

An agentic session is considered efficient or optimal when the agent provides a precise answer or resolution to every user ask, with an efficient path. An ask could be a question that requires an answer, or a request that requires a resolution through tool usage.

Efficiency here means the agent does not make redundant tool calls, ask redundant questions/clarifications to the user, is precise and concise in its communication, and reaches its goal in minimal steps needed.

This is a **boolean** metric, returning a confidence score that the agent is efficient. The score ranges from 0% (no confidence the agent is efficient) to 100% (complete confidence that the agent is efficient).
