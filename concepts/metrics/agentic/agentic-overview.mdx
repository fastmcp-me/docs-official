Agentic metrics help you measure how well your AI agents perform complex, multi-step tasks—especially when those agents need to use tools, make decisions, or interact with external systems. These metrics and helpful for those for anyone building advanced AI assistants, workflow automation, or any system where the AI acts on behalf of a user.

Use agentic metrics when you want to:
- Track whether your agent is making meaningful progress toward its goals.
- Detect and diagnose errors that occur when your agent uses tools or APIs.
- Ensure your agent is choosing the best tools or actions for each situation.

Below is a quick reference table of all agentic performance metrics:
