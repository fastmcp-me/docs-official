<strong>User Intent Change</strong> checks if users are using your agent system for different intents across multi-turn conversations.
</DefinitionCard>

User Intent Change is a binary evaluation metric, and is defined as a significant shift in the user's primary conversational goal or workflow during a session, relative to their initial stated intent.

This is a **boolean** metric, returning a confidence score that the user intent has changed significantly. The score ranges from 0% (no confidence the user intent has changed) to 100% (complete confidence that the user intent has changed).
