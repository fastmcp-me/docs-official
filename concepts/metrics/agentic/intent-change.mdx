**Intent change** is a custom LLM-as-a-judge session-level metric, with a pre-created prompt available from Galileo.

<DefinitionCard>
<strong>Intent Change</strong> is a binary evaluation metric, and is defined as a significant shift in the user's primary conversational goal or workflow during a session, relative to their initial stated intent.
</DefinitionCard>

This metric is specifically designed to analyze the entire user interaction, providing a holistic view of user intent management across multi-turn dialogues.

This is a **boolean** metric, returning either 0% (false) or 100% (true) - 0% means the there was no significant shift in the user's primary conversational goal, 100% means there was a significant shift. If you use multiple judges, then the score will be a percentage based on the number of judges who scored true vs false. For example, if 4 out of 5 scored the metric as true, the score would be 80%.

## Create the agent efficiency metric

This metric needs to be manually created, using a prompt defined by Galileo.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a new LLM-as-a-judge metric">
Create a new LLM-as-a-judge metric by following the instructions in our [LLM-as-a-judge concept guide](/concepts/metrics/custom-metrics/custom-metrics-ui-llm).

Use the following settings:

| Setting           | Value |
| :---------------- | ----- |
| Name              | `Intent change` |
| LLM Model         | Select your preferred model |
| Apply to          | **Session** |
| Advanced Settings | Configure these as required for your needs |

</Step>
<Step title="Set the prompt">

Set the prompt to the following:

<SnippetPrompt/>

</Step>

<Step title="Save the metric">
Save the metric, then turn it on for your Log stream.
</Step>
</Steps>

Your metric is now ready to use in your project.
