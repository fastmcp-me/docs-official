_**Definition:**_ _Context Adherence_ is a measurement of _closed-domain_ _hallucinations:_ cases where your model said things that were not provided in the context.

If a response is _adherent_ to the context (i.e. it has a value of 1 or close to 1), it only contains information given in the context. If a response is _not adherent_ (i.e. it has a value of 0 or close to 0), it's likely to contain facts not included in the context provided to the model.

### Context adherence with Luna-2

You can also leverage Galileo's [proprietary Evaluation SLMs](https://galileo.ai/research) to calculate context adherence.

_Context Adherence Luna_ is computed using Galileo in-house small language models (Luna-2). Context Adherence Luna is a cost-effective way to scale up your RAG evaluation workflows.
