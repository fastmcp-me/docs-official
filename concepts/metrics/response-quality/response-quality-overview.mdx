Response quality metrics help you measure how well your AI system answers user questions, follows instructions, and provides useful information. These metrics are key for building reliable, helpful, and user-friendly AI applications.

Use these metrics when you want to:

- Check that the model follows instructions and uses retrieved information effectively.
- Evaluate how well your system grounds answers in context or source material.

Below is a quick reference table of all response quality metrics:
