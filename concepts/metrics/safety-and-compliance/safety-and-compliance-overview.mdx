Safety and compliance metrics help you ensure your AI systems are safe, fair, and meet regulatory requirements. These metrics are essential for protecting users, avoiding harmful outputs, and building trust in your AI applications.

Use these metrics when you want to:
- Detect and prevent the exposure of sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII).
- Identify and filter out toxic, biased, or inappropriate content.
- Guard against prompt injection attacks and other security risks.
- Ensure your AI meets industry or legal compliance standards.
