import VSCodeConfig from "/snippets/code/mcp/mcp-config-vscode.mdx";

The Galileo Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enables seamless integration between AI-powered IDEs, such as Cursor, or VS Code with GitHub Copilot, and Galileo's evaluation and observability platform.

With MCP, you can access Galileo's capabilities directly from your development environment, including:

- Creating and managing datasets
- Running experiments
- Setting up prompt templates
- Getting insights on Log streams
- Integrating Galileo with your code

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

<Steps>
<Step title="AI-enabled IDE">
Install an AI-enabled IDE such as [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with AI capabilities
</Step>

<Step title="API key">
Generate your Galileo API key from the [API keys page](https://app.galileo.ai/settings/api-keys)
</Step>
</Steps>

## Configure your IDE

The Galileo MCP server works with both Cursor and VS Code. Follow the steps below for your IDE:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="VS Code">
<Steps>
<Step title="Install GitHub Copilot">
Install the [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) extension if you haven't already
</Step>
<Step title="Open MCP settings">
Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows/Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac) and search for **"MCP: Open User Configuration"**
</Step>
<Step title="Add the Galileo MCP server configuration">
Copy and paste the configuration below. Replace `YOUR-API-KEY` with your actual Galileo API key.

<VSCodeConfig />
</Step>
<Step title="Reload VS Code">
Reload VS Code by opening the Command Palette and running **"Developer: Reload Window"** for the changes to take effect
</Step>
</Steps>
</Tab>
<Tab title="Cursor">
<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Tools & MCP settings">
Open the Cursor command palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows/Linux, or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac), then choose"Open MCP Settings".
</Step>
<Step title="Open the MCP server configuration file">
Select **New MCP Server** to open the `mcp.json` MCP configuration file.
</Step>
<Step title="Add the Galileo MCP server configuration">
Copy and paste the configuration below. Replace `YOUR-API-KEY` with your actual Galileo API key.

<CursorConfig />
</Step>
<Step title="Save and restart">
Save the configuration and restart Cursor for the changes to take effect
</Step>
</Steps>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
The configuration is the same for both Cursor and VS Code. Make sure to replace `YOUR-API-KEY` with your actual Galileo API key from the [API keys page](https://app.galileo.ai/settings/api-keys).
</Tip>

## Verify your setup

Once configured, you can verify your MCP setup by asking your AI assistant
in your IDE:

<CodeGroup>

```text Example Query
