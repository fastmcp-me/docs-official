When you create a new Galileo account or organization, you get a set of sample projects, pre-populated with Log streams, calculated metrics, and insights.

![A list of sample projects in a new organization](/getting-started/sample-projects/sample-project-list.webp)

These projects are:

- [A simple terminal-based chatbot to chat with an LLM](/getting-started/sample-projects/simple-chatbot)
- [A multi-agent banking chatbot with LangGraph](/getting-started/sample-projects/multi-agent)

You can use these sample projects to learn how to navigate Log streams, understand metrics, use insights, log your AI applications, or run experiments in code.
