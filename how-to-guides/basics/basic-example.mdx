When working with OpenAI's API, it's important to set up your environment and client correctly to ensure secure and efficient API calls. This guide shows you how to create a basic integration using Galileo's OpenAI client wrapper.

<Note>
  The Galileo OpenAI wrapper currently only supports the synchronous chat completions API.
</Note>

### What you'll need

- OpenAI API key
- Galileo API key
- Python or TypeScript environment
- Required packages installed

### Basic setup requirements

- **Environment Variables**: Secure storage of API keys
- **Required Packages**: Galileo and OpenAI clients
- **Python Environment**: 3.9 or higher recommended

## Implementation steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Set Up Environment Variables">

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

<CodeGroup>
<GalileoOpenAIEnvVars/>
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
This assumes you are using a free Galileo account. If you are using a custom deployment, then you will also need to add the URL of your Galileo Console:

```ini .env
GALILEO_CONSOLE_URL=your-Galileo-console-URL
```
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Install Required Dependencies">

Install the required dependencies for your app. If you are using Python, create a virtual environment using your preferred method, then install dependencies inside that environment:

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetInstallPython />
  <SnippetInstallTypeScript />
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Initialize the Client">

- Import required packages
- Load environment variables
- Create OpenAI client instance with Galileo wrapper

</Step>
<Step title="Create a Chat Completion">

- Structure your prompt
- Call the API using the client
- Process and use the response

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetCreateAppPython />
  <SnippetCreateAppTypeScript />
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
</Steps>

Your logging is now set up! You are ready to configure metrics for your project.
