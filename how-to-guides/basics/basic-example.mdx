## Overview

When working with OpenAI's API, it's important to set up your environment and client correctly to ensure secure and efficient API calls. This guide shows you how to create a basic integration using Galileo's OpenAI client wrapper.

<Note>
  The Galileo OpenAI wrapper currently only supports the synchronous chat completions API.
</Note>

## Before you start

To complete this how-to, you will need:

- An [OpenAI API key](https://openai.com/api/)
- A [Galileo project](/concepts/projects) configured
- Your [Galileo API key](https://app.galileo.ai/settings/api-keys)

## Create a chat client using the Galileo OpenAI wrapper

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a file for your application called app.py or app.ts."/>

<Step title="Add code to call OpenAI">

Add the following code to your application file:

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetCreateAppPython />
  <SnippetCreateAppTypeScript />
</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Run the app">

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
python app.py
```

```bash TypeScript
npx tsx app.ts
```

</CodeGroup>

When the app runs, the span will be logged automatically, with the input as the `prompt`, the output as the returned `response`. The duration and number of tokens will also be logged.

</Step>

<Step title="View the logged trace">

From the [Galileo Console](https://app.galileo.ai), open the Log stream for your project. You will see a trace with a single span containing the logged function call.

</Step>
</Steps>

Your logging is now set up! You are ready to configure metrics for your project.
