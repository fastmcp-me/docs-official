Welcome to our how-to guides for optimizing and fixing AI applications.

Each guide shows you how to spot problems, understand what metrics reveal, see examples of poor setups, and follow clear steps to fix issues.

## Troubleshooting and optimizing your AI applications

We've organized these guides by application type to help you solve specific problems in your AI systems. Whether you're dealing with hallucinating models, inefficient agents, or poor retrievals, you'll find practical advice based on metrics and proven fixes.
