## Where can I find my project keys in the Galileo application?

When using Galileo there are three different types of keys that you may use.

1. Galileo API Key (`GALILEO_API_KEY`)
2. Galileo Project ID (`GALILEO_PROJECT`)
3. Galileo Log Stream (`GALILEO_LOG_STREAM`)

These keys help to connect your application to Galileo's services.

Let's break down what each key does and where to find it within the UI.

### Galileo API key

The Galileo API key is a secure digital key that allows your applications to communicate with Galileo's services. When developing AI applications, you'll need this API key to connect Galileo to start the evaluation or monitoring process.

#### Where to find the Galileo API key?

1. Login and open your Galileo App instance.
2. From the main Projects Dashboard, access the user menu by clicking on your profile avatar in the upper right hand corner of your screen.
3. From the dropdown that appears, click "Settings & Users"
4. On the left-hand side menu, select "API Keys"
5. If you've already created an API Key, you will see it listed below.
6. Create a new API key by navigating to the blue button that says "Create New Key"
7. Give the key a name, and copy and paste it somewhere safe — Note, keys can only be created once and will not be viewable again.

Your API key is now ready to use in integrations or local development setups. Make sure to keep it secret and rotate periodically for security.

### Where do I find my Galileo project ID?

Your Galileo Project ID is the name of the project you create.

# If your project name has spaces / capitalization matters, etc...

### Where do I find my Galileo Log stream?

The Galileo Log Stream identity is the name of the specific Log stream that you are looking to record your logs in.

To create a Log stream, first select the project you'd want to create a Log stream from.
Then, select `Connect your app` from the project home screen.

Once you've selected the `Connect your app` button, you'll see a modal pop up, select `Create Log stream`

![Click `Create Log stream` to continue creating Log stream](/images/create-log-stream-2.png).

Galileo will create a default Log stream with the key `my_log_stream` please be aware that this key is case-sensitive.

You can create additional Log streams for the same project by navigating to the left-hand side of the screen, toggling down and selecting the `Create Log stream` button.

Its from within this dropdown menu that you can also edit or delete Log streams. Keep in mind that the keys are case-sensitive, so if you change the name of the Log stream, you will also have to change how it is referenced within your application as well.

## Best practices and tips

- Keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly
- Create separate keys for different applications or environments
- Set expiration dates for temporary access
- Regularly rotate keys for enhanced security
- Use descriptive names to track key usage
