## Where can I find my project keys in the Galileo application?

When using Galileo there are three different types of keys that you may use.

1. Galileo API Key (`GALILEO_API_KEY`)
2. Galileo Project ID (`GALILEO_PROJECT`)
3. Galileo Log stream (`GALILEO_LOG_STREAM`)

These keys help to connect your application to Galileo's services.

Let's break down what each key does and where to find it within the UI.

### Where do I find my Galileo project ID?

Your Galileo Project ID is the name of the project you create.

### Where do I find my Galileo Log stream?

The Galileo Log stream identity is the name of the specific Log stream that you are looking to record your logs in.

To create a Log stream, first select the project you'd want to create a Log stream from.
Then, select `Connect your app` from the project home screen.

Once you've selected the `Connect your app` button, you'll see a modal pop up, select `Create Log stream`

![Click `Create Log stream` to continue creating Log stream](/images/create-log-stream-2.png).

Galileo will create a default Log stream with the key `my_log_stream` please be aware that this key is case-sensitive.

You can create additional Log streams for the same project by navigating to the left-hand side of the screen, toggling down and selecting the `Create Log stream` button.

Its from within this dropdown menu that you can also edit or delete Log streams. Keep in mind that the keys are case-sensitive, so if you change the name of the Log stream, you will also have to change how it is referenced within your application as well.

## Best practices and tips

- Keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly
- Create separate keys for different applications or environments
- Set expiration dates for temporary access
- Regularly rotate keys for enhanced security
- Use descriptive names to track key usage
