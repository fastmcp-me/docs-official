<Update label="2025-08-22" description="Enhanced SDK, CrewAI Integration, and Insights Improvements">

## Key new features and improvements

### New CrewAI integration

New native [integration with CrewAI](/how-to-guides/third-party-integrations/add-galileo-to-crewai/add-galileo-to-crewai) to provide better observability and debugging capabilities for agents and multi-agent workflows within the CrewAI framework. The integration now offers improved logging, metrics tracking, and session management for complex agent interactions.

### SDK improvements and deprecation updates

- **[Deprecated method updates](/sdk-api/python/reference/prompts) for Python SDK prompts**: The `create_prompt_template` method has been deprecated in favor of `create_prompt`, and `get_prompt_template` has been deprecated in favor of `get_prompt`for better clarity and consistency. These changes improve the API design while maintaining backward compatibility during the transition period.
- **Fixed data type handling**: The `get_prompt` method now returns the correct data type, resolving issues with prompt retrieval and ensuring consistent behavior across the SDK.
- **Updated SDK examples**: The Python SDK examples have been refreshed with improved code patterns and best practices, particularly in the dataset experiments workflow.

### Synthetic data generation

Galileo now supports [synthetic data generation](/sdk-api/experiments/datasets#synthetic-data-generation), allowing you to create training and evaluation datasets via the UI. This feature enables you to generate diverse, controlled datasets for testing your AI applications without manual data collection.

Use synthetic data generation to:

- Create large-scale datasets for comprehensive testing
- Generate edge cases and challenging scenarios
- Ensure consistent data quality across experiments
- Rapidly prototype and iterate on your AI applications

### Log Stream Insights performance improvements

The Log Stream Insights feature has been optimized for better performance and user experience:

- **Reduced processing overhead**: Insights backend processing is now disabled by default for enterprise customers, reducing unnecessary costs and improving system performance.
- **On-demand insights**: Users can now trigger Log Stream Insights manually through the UI when needed, providing more control over when insights are generated.
- **Enhanced reliability**: Improved error handling and processing stability to reduce the frequency of issues encountered by customers.
These changes make the Insights feature more robust and cost-effective while maintaining its powerful analysis capabilities for agent debugging and optimization.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-08-01" description="Aggregate Agent Graph View">

## Key new features

### Aggregate agent graph view

Galileo's agent reliability suite now includes an Aggregate Agent Graph View, letting you visualize the most common paths your agent takes across [sessions](/concepts/logging/sessions/sessions-overview). This feature helps surface usage trends, component performance, and outlier behaviors that are otherwise hard to spot in individual traces or spans.

With agent-based architectures becoming more complex and non-deterministic, having an aggregated DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) view is crucial for debugging, optimizing, and validating agent workflows at scale.

![Screenshot of Galileo's Aggregate Agent Graph View showing a visual DAG of an agent's execution paths over a 6-month period.](/images/release-notes/2025-08-01/2025-08-01-multi-agent-graph-view-v2.webp)

</Update>

<Update label="2025-07-25" description="Build Your Own Evaluation Metrics and Track Agent Workflows">

## Key new features

### Build custom evaluation metrics with your own prompt

Define your own evaluation metrics by providing a custom prompt. This gives you full control to evaluate outputs based on specific criteria, allowing for tailored evaluations based on your needs.

Apply these metrics at span, trace, or session levels, or create agentic metrics to evaluate complete workflows.  Currently, outputs are binary only (e.g., Pass/Fail) but support for numerical, categorical, and text-based outputs are on the roadmap.

### Agentic metrics for workflow evaluations

Galileo has four new metrics specifically designed for agent workflows. Use these metrics to track efficiency, quality, and intent across multi-step agent processes.

These metrics include:

- **Agent Flow** - Ensures the agent followed the ideal execution path.
- **Agent Efficiency** - Rewards concise, goal-oriented behavior while avoiding redundant steps or unnecessary tool calls.
- **Conversation Quality** - Session-level metric for evaluating overall conversation quality. Uses multi-trace inputs/outputs and does not require thinking logs or tool logs.
- **Intent Change** - Detects user intent shifts throughout a conversation, helping identify changes in user goals.

Apply these metrics at [span](/sdk-api/logging/galileo-logger#add-spans), [trace](/sdk-api/logging/galileo-logger#start-a-trace#traces), or [session levels](/concepts/logging/sessions/sessions-overview), or create agentic metrics to evaluate complete workflows.

These metrics pair well with Galileo's high-signal agent-centric [metrics](/concepts/metrics/overview#metrics-overview) including [tool selection](/concepts/metrics/agentic/tool-error), [action advancement](/concepts/metrics/agentic/action-advancement#understanding-action-advancement), and [instruction adherence](/concepts/metrics/response-quality/instruction-adherence).

### Export logs

Export selected or all logs from log streams and experiments in either CSV or JSON format with the columns of your choosing. This allows you to upload them into datalakes, add them to an archive, further explore the data, maintain them for compliance purposes, or whatever else may fit your needs.

![A GIF of logs being exported from a log stream](/images/release-notes/2025-07-25/2025-07-25-log-stream-exports.gif)

### Columns in all experiments table

View more information around the dataset, model, or prompt used in an experiment from within the all experiments table. Navigate via links to the relevant dataset or prompt to explore deeper within the project.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-07-11" description="Alerting, Prompt Versioning, and GenAI Protection">

## Key new features

### Slack and email alerts on your applications

Keep close tabs on your AI apps and agents with the ability to create Slack or email alerts on your log streams. Get notified on the metrics that matter most to you and your team — whether its [correctness](/concepts/metrics/response-quality/correctness), output [PII](/concepts/metrics/safety-and-compliance/pii), [context relevance](/concepts/metrics/response-quality/context-relevance), or more. Leverage flexible thresholds and conditions to optimize for the right balance between signal and noise.

![Galileo Release Notes](/images/release-notes/2025-07-11/2025-07-create-alert.webp)

### Save and version prompts in the prompt store

Save your prompts in a central prompt store with built-in version control. From within the playground, load an existing prompt from the prompt store, edit the prompt and save as either a new prompt or new version of existing prompt.  Check out different versions of the prompt or even rollback to previous versions as needed.

![Galileo Prompt Store and versioning view](/images/release-notes/2025-07-11/2025-07-prompt-store.webp)

### Proactive GenAI security with updated Protect safeguards

Protect has been added to the latest version of the [Galileo Python SDK](/sdk-api/python/reference/protect) to intercept prompts and outputs to proactively safeguard your organization and your end-users from unwanted or even dangerous outputs. Get started with Protect's safeguards through [Galileo Metrics](/concepts/metrics/overview). Protect is specifically designed to defend your application against:

- Harmful requests and security threats (e.g. [Prompt Injections](/concepts/metrics/safety-and-compliance/prompt-injection), toxic language)
- Data Privacy protection (e.g. PII leakage)
- [Hallucinations](/how-to-guides/conversational-ai/fixing-hallucinations-and-factual-errors)

</Update>

<Update label="2025-06-25" description="Improve your agents with Agent Insights">

## Key new features

### Galileo agent insight engine

Get insights into how to improve your agent: Galileo now analyzes your logs, identifies potential problems and provides them on your project dashboard. Agents can fail in numerous ways that are different from traditional software. The Galileo agent [Insights Engine](https://galileo.ai/insights-engine) knows what to look for, classifies them and even provides suggested actions to remediate them.

![Galileo agent Insights Engine](/images/release-notes/2025-06-25/2025-06-Galileo-Insights-Engine.webp)

#### Identify trends within log metrics

Keep your eyes on trends happening within your project's log stream metrics over a period of time to easily identify anomalies or find patterns. Dive deeper into patterns with additional views, filtering and groups of trend lines based on available parameters.

![Trends in log metrics](/images/release-notes/2025-06-25/2025-06-Trends-In-Log-Metrics.webp)

#### Chart view for experiments

You can now view the results of any experiment in an easy-to-digest chart view, allowing you to gain further meaning behind metric performance.  Further explore the charts with the help of filters to examine metric samples by clicking into the visualization.

![Retriever node visualization](/images/release-notes/2025-06-25/2025-06-Retriever-Node-Visualization.webp)

### Metric versioning and customization per log stream

Now, you can view and restore previous versions of metrics directly in the metrics hub interface.  Test out different versions of a metric, or use different versions of a metric across different log streams and experiments.  Helpful for scenarios where you may want to explore different changes without impacting existing logs or charts.

### Automatic session naming

Sessions are now named automatically using available session data if no custom name is provided.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-06-13" description="Sessions as Graph, Log Stream Insights, Playground History, and Local Metrics">

## Key new features

More powerful agent observability with updates to three complementary views—Timeline, Conversation, and Graph—designed to help you debug faster, detect issues earlier, and understand agent performance from every angle.

### Trace agent execution in real-time with timeline view

Galileo's new **Timeline View** lets you step through your agent's full execution path, making it easier to pinpoint delays and spot bottlenecks at a glance.
No more digging through scattered logs—see how long each tool or agent step takes and where latency builds up.

Click on any step to inspect metadata, inputs/outputs, and nested actions, giving you full visibility into what's slowing things down.

![Timeline View Updates](/images/release-notes/2025-06-16/2025-06-16-Timeline-Quick.gif)


### Debug from the user's perspective with conversation view

The new **Conversation View** recreates the exact exchange your users experienced—from inputs to outputs—side by side with system decisions. This helps you debug how your agent logic feels in practice, not just how it functions under the hood.

Use it to:

- Spot confusing or off-track responses
- Validate that the system matches user intent
- Reproduce and resolve edge cases faster

![Conversation View Updates](/images/release-notes/2025-06-16/2025-06-16-Conversation-View-sm.gif)

### Combine with graph view for end-to-end observability

These new views pair well with last week's Graph view release, which transforms traditional logs into interactive, inspectable agent flows.

Use the full trio to:

- Graph View: Visualize decision paths and tool usage
- Timeline View: Identify performance issues and slowdowns
- Conversation View: Understand the user experience start to finish

With these improvements, you can get a more holistic view of agent behavior.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-06-05" description="Sessions as Graph, Log Stream Insights, Playground History, and Local Metrics">

## Key new features

Faster debugging, smarter issue detection, seamless experiment saving, and custom metric support for streamlined GenAI evaluation.

### Visualize sessions with graph view

Galileo's new **Graph View** replaces traditional tree-based log visualization, enabling you to **analyze complex sessions quickly**. Instead of digging through a deeply nested tree with hundreds of logs, you can now explore each trace as an interactive graph.

Click any node to inspect inputs, outputs, metrics, and intermediate actions, making it easier to identify bottlenecks, trace failures, and debug long-running workflows.

### Detect issues automatically with Log stream insights (Beta)

Galileo's **Log Stream Insights** automatically scans your logs to **surface common failure patterns and recurring issues**, saving you hours of manual review. For each surfaced issue, users receive:

- Descriptions of the detected pattern
- Concrete examples across traces
- Suggested remediation strategies
- Frequency trends over time

This helps teams reduce MTTD (mean time to detect) and rapidly address performance regressions.

![A GIF showing Log stream insights](/images/release-notes/2025-06-05/2025-06-05-Log-Stream-Insights-s.gif)

### Preserve work and experiment freely with playground saving & history

Galileo now **automatically saves your Playground session state**, so you never lose work in progress. You can:

- Resume where you left off without manual saves
- Save multiple sessions to explore variations in prompts and workflows
- Access run history and log experiments for repeatability

This feature enables your team to **iterate faster and collaborate more effectively** within a single project environment.

![A GIF showing new playground persistence feature](/images/release-notes/2025-06-05/2025-06-05-Playground-Updates.gif)

### Evaluate with your own metrics using local scorers

With **Local Custom Metrics**, you can now define and compute **custom evaluation metrics locally** using your existing Python workflows and evaluation logic. These metrics can be uploaded directly into your Galileo experiments for side-by-side comparison with built-in metrics.

This gives you complete control over your evaluation criteria while centralizing metric tracking inside Galileo experiments.
Use it to:

- Seamlessly integrate with local libraries and tools
- Rapidly iterate on evaluation logic
- Gain full metric visibility within your evaluations
- Compare experiments at a glance to determine the best results

</Update>

<Update label="2025-05-13" description="Sessions, CLHF, and Playground improvements">

## Key new features

### Sessions

The free version of Galileo now has support for Sessions. Sessions provide users a coherent view of multi-turn interactions. The traces from each turn of the conversation can be viewed under the session.

To create a session, developers can use the Galileo Logger, using the `start_session` method in Python ot the `startSession` method in TypeScript.

Here is a multi-turn conversation about state capitals of the US:

![A multi turn conversation about state capitals](/images/release-notes/2025-5-13/sessions.png)

### Adapting LLM metrics with CLHF

The free Galileo offering now supports [**Continuous Learning for Human Feedback** (CLHF)](concepts/metrics/custom-metrics/continuous-learning-via-human-feedback) which helps users easily adapt LLM metrics for their app by providing human feedback.  As you start using Galileo Preset LLM-powered metrics (e.g. Context Adherence or Instruction Adherence), or start creating your own LLM-powered metrics, you might not always agree with the results. This capability helps you solve this problem.

As you identify mistakes in your metrics, you can provide ‘feedback' to ‘auto-improve' your metrics. Your feedback gets translated (by LLMs) into few-shot examples that are appended to the Metric's prompt.

This process has shown to increase accuracy of metrics by 20-30%.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-05-02" description="Metrics on experiments UI, public APIs, and more">

## Key new features

### Metrics on experiments UI

You can now compute additional metrics for logged experiments directly within the experiments UI. Until now, users didn't have a way to compute more metrics for logged experiments from the UI or SDK.

![Metrics on experiments UI](images/AddingMetricstoExperimentsinUI-ezgif.com-optimize.gif)

### Public APIs

Released [public APIs](/api-reference/) to allow developers to manage Log streams, experiments, and trace data programmatically. While these can already be managed through the TypeScript and Python SDK, public APIs allow users to programmatically interact with these components in any language. Sample use cases include logging data from a production AI app, running experiments, and retrieving evaluation result

### Aggregate metrics and ranking criteria for experiments

Added to All Experiments page. Aggregate metrics compile the metric values from individual traces in an experiment to show a combined value for each metric on the all experiments page. This enables you to quickly assess the performance of the underlying traces in an experiment. Ranking criteria allow you to determine which experiments were most successful by specifying a weighted average of the underlying metrics for each experiment.

![Ranking Criteria Interface](images/Added-aggregate-metrics.png)

### Reference output and metadata availability

The reference output and metadata from the datasets are now available in the corresponding experiment traces so it can easily referenced.

![Reference Output Interface](images/Reference-output-and-metadata-from-datasets.png)

## Datasets and playground

### Enhanced playground inputs

to show complete dataset input rather than only variables so you can more flexibly define variable inputs.

![Enhanced Playground Inputs](images/playground-enhanced-inputs.png)

### Flatten to text in dataset upload

When uploading datasets from a CSV or JSON file, the contents of a column are automatically flattened to text instead of being stored as JSON when there's only one file column mapped to an input, output or dataset column.

![Flatten to Text Dataset Upload](images/flatten-to-text-dataset-upload.png)

### New model in playground and metrics

Added Support for new GPT 4.1 model in playground and metrics.

## SDK

### G2.0 TypeScript SDK improvements

Supporting Export types at the top-level (`galileo/types`), added a method to access the singleton logger.

## General usability

### Performance optimization

Resolved performance issues causing occasional UI slowdowns, ensuring smoother and faster navigation.

### Extended session durations

Reduce repetitive Google sign-ins, improving user convenience.

### Support chat icon control

You now have the option to show or hide the support chat icon, customizing your interface according to your preferences. Previously, the support chat icon would overlap and cover key user interface elements. This change makes it easier to access the full user interface without the chat icon getting in the way.

</Update>
