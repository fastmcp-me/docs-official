Rulesets are grouped sets of rules, combined with an associated action. Rulesets are triggered if all the rules in the set are triggered, performing an `and` operation across all the rules. Once a rule set is triggered, the action can be used in your application to decide what response to return to the user.

Rulesets can be created up front and added to [central stages](/sdk-api/protect/stages#central-stages) for use later in applications, or created in your application and used with a [local stage](/sdk-api/protect/stages#local-stages)

## Actions

When a rule set is triggered, it returns an action to tell your application what to do. This is particularly useful when using [central stages](/sdk-api/protect/stages#central-stages) where the action can be managed by a central AI governance team to provide standard and approved responses.

There are 2 types of action, passthrough and override.

### Passthrough actions

Passthrough actions are the default, and tell your application to handle the triggered rule set using logic managed inside your application. As this is the default, you don't need to set a passthrough action when creating a ruleset.

### Override actions

Override actions override your application logic by providing a random selection from a choice of one or more pre-set responses. This allows for centrally managed responses, with randomness to give different responses to different users from a pre-defined set.

When you create the override action, you can set the choices:

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCreateActionPython/>
</CodeGroup>

You can then get the selected choice from the response:

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetGetActionResponsePython/>
</CodeGroup>

## Create rulesets

To create a ruleset, first create the [rules](/sdk-api/protect/rules), then create an [action](#actions) if needed, then pass these to the ruleset, with an optional description.

<SnippetCreateRulesetPython/>
</CodeGroup>
