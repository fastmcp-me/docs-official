## GalileoApiClient Objects

```python
@define
class GalileoApiClient(AuthenticatedClient)
```

A Client which has been authenticated for use on secured endpoints

The following are accepted as keyword arguments and will be used to construct httpx Clients internally:

    ``base_url``: The base URL for the API, all requests are made to a relative path to this URL
        This can also be set via the GALILEO_CONSOLE_URL environment variable

    ``api_key``: The API key to be sent with every request
        This can also be set via the GALILEO_API_KEY environment variable

    ``cookies``: A dictionary of cookies to be sent with every request

    ``headers``: A dictionary of headers to be sent with every request

    ``timeout``: The maximum amount of a time a request can take. API functions will raise
    httpx.TimeoutException if this is exceeded.

    ``verify_ssl``: Whether or not to verify the SSL certificate of the API server. This should be True in production,
    but can be set to False for testing purposes.

    ``follow_redirects``: Whether or not to follow redirects. Default value is False.

    ``httpx_args``: A dictionary of additional arguments to be passed to the ``httpx.Client`` and ``httpx.AsyncClient`` constructor.

**Arguments**:

- ``0: Whether or not to raise an errors.UnexpectedStatus if the API returns a
status code that was not documented in the source OpenAPI document. Can also be provided as a keyword
argument to the constructor.
- ``1: The token to use for authentication
- ``2: The prefix to use for the Authorization header
- ``3: The name of the Authorization header
