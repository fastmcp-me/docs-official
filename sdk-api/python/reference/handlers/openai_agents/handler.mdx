```

OpenAI Agents TracingProcessor for logging traces to Galileo.

Builds a tree of spans during agent execution and logs them hierarchically

**Arguments**:

- `_galileo_logger` (`GalileoLogger`): The Galileo logger instance.
- `_flush_on_trace_end` (`bool`): Whether to automatically flush the log batch to Galileo when a trace ends.
- `_nodes` (`dict[str, Node]`): Stores Node objects keyed by their OpenAI span_id or trace_id (for root).
