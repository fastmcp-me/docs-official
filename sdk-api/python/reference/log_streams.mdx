## LogStream Objects

```python
class LogStream(LogStreamResponse)
```

Log streams are used to organize logs within a project on the Galileo platform.

They provide a way to categorize and group related logs, making it easier to
analyze and monitor specific parts of your application or different environments
(e.g., production, staging, development).

**Arguments**:

- `created_at` (`datetime.datetime`): The timestamp when the log stream was created.
- `created_by` (`str`): The identifier of the user who created the log stream.
- `id` (`str`): The unique identifier of the log stream.
- `name` (`str`): The name of the log stream.
- `project_id` (`str`): The ID of the project this log stream belongs to.
- `datetime.datetime`0 (`datetime.datetime`): The timestamp when the log stream was last updated.
- `datetime.datetime`2 (`datetime.datetime`3): Additional properties associated with the log stream.

## LogStreams Objects

```python
class LogStreams(BaseClientModel, DecorateAllMethods)
```

#### list

```python
def list(*,
         project_id: Optional[str] = None,
         project_name: Optional[str] = None) -> builtins.list[LogStream]
```

Lists all log streams. Exactly one of `project_id` or `project_name` must be provided.

**Arguments**:

- `project_id` (`Optional[str]`): The ID of the project to list log streams for.
- `project_name` (`Optional[str]`): The name of the project to list log streams for.

**Raises**:

- `ValueError`: If neither or both `project_id` and `project_name` are provided.
- `errors.UnexpectedStatus`: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
- `project_name`0: If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.

**Returns**:

`project_name`1: A list of log streams.

#### get

```python
def get(*,
        id: Optional[str] = None,
        name: Optional[str] = None,
        project_id: Optional[str] = None,
        project_name: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[LogStream]
```

Retrieves a log stream by id or name.

**Arguments**:

- `id` (`Optional[str]`): The id of the log stream. Defaults to None.
- `name` (`Optional[str]`): The name of the log stream. Defaults to None.
- `project_id` (`Optional[str]`): The ID of the project. Defaults to None.
- `project_name` (`Optional[str]`): The name of the project. Defaults to None.

**Raises**:

- `ValueError`: If neither or both `id` and `name` are provided, or if neither or both
`project_id` and `project_name` are provided.
- `Optional[str]`3: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
- `Optional[str]`4: If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.

**Returns**:

`Optional[str]`5: The log stream if found, None otherwise.

#### create

```python
def create(name: str,
           *,
           project_id: Optional[str] = None,
           project_name: Optional[str] = None) -> LogStream
```

Creates a new log stream. Exactly one of `project_id` or `project_name` must be provided.

**Arguments**:

- `name` (`str`): The name of the log stream.
- `project_id` (`Optional[str]`): The ID of the project to create the log stream in. Defaults to None.
- `project_name` (`Optional[str]`): The name of the project to create the log stream in. Defaults to None.

**Raises**:

- `ValueError`: If neither or both `project_id` and `project_name` are provided, or if the project is not found.
- `project_name`1: If the server validation fails.
- `project_name`2: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
- `project_name`3: If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.

**Returns**:

`project_name`4: The created log stream.

#### get\_log\_stream

```python
def get_log_stream(*,
                   name: Optional[str] = None,
                   project_id: Optional[str] = None,
                   project_name: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[LogStream]
```

Retrieves a log stream by name. Exactly one of `project_id` or `project_name` must be provided.

**Arguments**:

- `name` (`Optional[str]`): The name of the log stream. Defaults to None.
- `project_id` (`Optional[str]`): The ID of the project. Defaults to None.
- `project_name` (`Optional[str]`): The name of the project. Defaults to None.

**Raises**:

- `ValueError`: If neither or both `project_id` and `project_name` are provided.
- `project_name`1: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
- `project_name`2: If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.

**Returns**:

`project_name`3: The log stream if found, None otherwise.

#### list\_log\_streams

```python
def list_log_streams(*,
                     project_id: Optional[str] = None,
                     project_name: Optional[str] = None) -> list[LogStream]
