## GalileoBatchLogger Objects

```python
class GalileoBatchLogger(TracesLogger, IGalileoLogger)
```

Galileo Batch logger class implements `IGalileoLogger` interface. It&#x27;s responsible for

split batch and streaming logic accordingly inside `GalileoLogger` class. So when you need
to add new method make sure you change IGalileoLogger class first and both loggers must implement
this logic, if logic same use directly GalileoLogger class.

Note: You should not use it directly and must use GalileoLogger instead with mode=&quot;batch&quot;


#### flush

```python
def flush() -> list[Trace]
```

Upload all traces to Galileo.
