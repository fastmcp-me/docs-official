## Scorers Objects

```python
class Scorers()
```

#### list

```python
def list(name: Optional[str] = None,
         types: Optional[list[ScorerTypes]] = None) -> list[ScorerResponse]
```

Lists scorers, optionally filtering by name and/or type.

The filters are combined with an AND condition, while the values within the `types`
list are combined with an OR condition.

For example, calling `list(name="my_scorer", types=[ScorerTypes.llm, ScorerTypes.code])`
will return scorers where the name is &quot;my_scorer&quot; AND the type is either &quot;llm&quot; OR &quot;code&quot;.

**Arguments**:

**Returns**:

A list of scorers that match the filter criteria.
