## Scorers

### get_scorer_version

```python
def get_scorer_version(self,
                       scorer_id: UUID,
                       version: int) -> Union[Unset, BaseScorerVersionResponse]
```

**Arguments**

- `name` (`str`): Name of the scorer
- `version` (`int`): Version of the scorer.

**Returns**

- `Scorer response if found, otherwise None.`: 

### list

```python
def list(self,
         name: Optional[str]=None,
         types: Optional[list[ScorerTypes]]=None) -> list[ScorerResponse]
```

Lists scorers, optionally filtering by name and/or type.

The filters are combined with an AND condition, while the values within the `types`
list are combined with an OR condition.

For example, calling `list(name="my_scorer", types=[ScorerTypes.llm, ScorerTypes.code])`
will return scorers where the name is "my_scorer" AND the type is either "llm" OR "code".

**Arguments**

- `name`: Name of the scorer to filter by.
- `types`: List of scorer types to filter by. Defaults to all scorers.

**Returns**

- `A list of scorers that match the filter criteria.`:

           run_id: str,
           scorers: list[ScorerConfig]) -> Optional[Union[HTTPValidationError, RunScorerSettingsResponse]]
```

**Arguments**

- `project_id`: ID of the project
- `run_id`: ID of the run
- `scorers`: List of scorer configurations

**Returns**
