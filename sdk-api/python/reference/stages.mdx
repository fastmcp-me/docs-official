#### create\_stage

```python
def create_stage(project_id: Optional[Union[str, UUID4]] = None,
                 project_name: Optional[str] = None,
                 name: Optional[str] = None,
                 stage_type: StageType = StageType.local,
                 pause: bool = False,
                 prioritized_rulesets: Optional[Sequence[Ruleset]] = None,
                 description: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[StageDB]
```

Creates a new stage.

**Arguments**:

- `project_id`: The ID of the project.
- `project_name`: Name of the project. If `project_id` is not provided,
this will be used to look up the project.
- `name`: Name of the stage. Defaults to a generated name.
- `stage_type`: Type of the stage.
- `pause`: Whether the stage should be created in a paused state.
- `prioritized_rulesets`: List of rulesets for the stage.
- `description`: Description for the stage.

**Returns**:

The newly created Stage.

#### get\_stage

```python
def get_stage(project_id: Optional[Union[str, UUID4]] = None,
              project_name: Optional[str] = None,
              stage_id: Optional[Union[str, UUID4]] = None,
              stage_name: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[StageDB]
```

Retrieves a stage by its ID or name, within a given project.

**Arguments**:

- `project_id`: ID of the project.
- `project_name`: Name of the project. If `project_id` is not provided,
this will be used to look up the project.
- `stage_id`: ID of the stage to retrieve.
- `stage_name`: Name of the stage to retrieve. If `stage_id` is not provided,
this will be used (in conjunction with project ID/name).

**Returns**:

The fetched Stage.

#### update\_stage

```python
def update_stage(
    project_id: Optional[Union[str, UUID4]] = None,
    project_name: Optional[str] = None,
    stage_id: Optional[Union[str, UUID4]] = None,
    stage_name: Optional[str] = None,
    prioritized_rulesets: Optional[Sequence[Ruleset]] = None
) -> Optional[StageDB]
```

Updates a stage&#x27;s rulesets, creating a new version.

**Arguments**:

- `project_id`: ID of the project.
- `project_name`: Name of the project. If `project_id` is not provided,
this will be used to look up the project.
- `stage_id`: ID of the stage to update.
- `stage_name`: Name of the stage to update. If `stage_id` is not provided,
this will be used (in conjunction with project ID/name).
- `prioritized_rulesets`: New list of prioritized rulesets for the stage.
If `None`, effectively clears existing rulesets.

**Returns**:

The updated Stage.

#### pause\_stage

```python
def pause_stage(project_id: Optional[Union[str, UUID4]] = None,
                project_name: Optional[str] = None,
                stage_id: Optional[Union[str, UUID4]] = None,
                stage_name: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[StageDB]
```

Pauses the specified stage.

Pauses a stage using either its ID or name within the context of a project.

**Arguments**:

- `project_id`: ID of the project containing the stage.
- `project_name`: Name of the project containing the stage.
(Used if `project_id` is not provided).
- `stage_id`: ID of the stage to pause.
- `stage_name`: Name of the stage to pause.
(Used if `stage_id` is not provided).

**Returns**:

The Stage with its updated pause state.

#### resume\_stage

```python
def resume_stage(project_id: Optional[Union[str, UUID4]] = None,
                 project_name: Optional[str] = None,
                 stage_id: Optional[Union[str, UUID4]] = None,
                 stage_name: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[StageDB]
```

Resumes a previously paused stage.

Resumes a stage using either its ID or name within the context of a project.

**Arguments**:

- `project_id`: ID of the project containing the stage.
- `project_name`: Name of the project containing the stage.
(Used if `project_id` is not provided).
- `stage_id`: ID of the stage to resume.
- `stage_name`: Name of the stage to resume.
