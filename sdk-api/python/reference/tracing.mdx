## Module

Utilities for distributed tracing with Galileo.

## get_tracing_headers

```python
def get_tracing_headers() -> dict[str, str]
```

Get tracing headers for distributed tracing (decorator usage).

Returns headers from the singleton logger context that can be passed to downstream services.
For direct logger instances, use logger.get_tracing_headers() instead.

**Raises**

- `GalileoLoggerException`: If not in distributed mode or if no trace has been started

**Returns**

- `dict[str, str]`: Dictionary with X-Galileo-Trace-ID and X-Galileo-Parent-ID headers

**Examples**

Using with decorators to propagate trace context to downstream services:

```python
from galileo import log, get_tracing_headers
import httpx

@log()
async def orchestrator():
    # Get headers to pass to downstream service
    headers = get_tracing_headers()

    # Call downstream service with trace context
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            "http://service:8000/process",
            headers=headers,
            json={"data": "..."}
        )
```
