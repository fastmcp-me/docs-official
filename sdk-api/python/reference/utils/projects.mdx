## resolve_project_id

```python
def resolve_project_id(project_id: Optional[str]=None,
                       project_name: Optional[str]=None,
                       allow_none: bool=False,
                       validate: bool=True) -> Optional[str]
```

Resolve project_name to project_id if needed.

**Arguments**

- `project_id` (`Optional[str]`): The project ID. If provided, returns it (optionally validating it exists).
- `project_name` (`Optional[str]`): The project name. If provided, looks up and returns the project ID.
- `allow_none` (`bool`): If True, allows both parameters to be None and returns None.
    If False, raises ValueError when both are None. Defaults to False.
- `validate` (`bool`): If True, validates that the project exists. If False, skips validation.
    Defaults to True.

**Raises**

- `ValueError`: If both project_id and project_name are provided,
or if neither is provided and allow_none=False,
or if the project doesn't exist (when validate=True).

**Returns**

- `Optional[str]`: The resolved project ID, or None if neither was provided and allow_none=True.
