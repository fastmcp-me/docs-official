The Galileo CrewAI integration allows you to automatically log all CrewAI interactions with LLMs, including prompts, responses, and performance metrics. The Galileo SDK has a custom event listener that listens to CrewAI events, and logs these to Galileo.

## Basic usage

The integration is based on the `CrewAIEventListener` class, which implements CrewAI's event listener. To use it, create an instance of the listener before you kick off your crew, for example in your `run` function. When this listener is created, it automatically registers event handlers to capture the relevant events.

  <SnippetCrewAIBasicPython />
</CodeGroup>

The `CrewAIEventListener` captures various CrewAI events, including:

- Crew Kickoff events
- Agent events
- Task events
- Tool usage
- LLM calls

For each of these events, the callback logs relevant information to Galileo, such as:

- Input prompts and messages
- Output responses
- Model information
- Timing data
- Token usage
- Error information (if any)

The `CrewAIEventListener` automatically handles nested crews and agents, creating a hierarchical trace that reflects the structure of your CrewAI application.

## Use a custom logger

When initializing the `CrewAIEventListener`, you can optionally specify a Galileo logger instance, either by creating a new logger, or by using the current logger from the Galileo context:

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetCrewAICustomLoggerPython />
</CodeGroup>

This is particularly useful if you want to call your CrewAI code from inside a function [decorated with the `log` decorator](/sdk-api/logging/log-decorator/log-decorator), or from inside an [experiment](/sdk-api/third-party-integrations/crewai/experiments).

### Session and trace support

Every time you kick off a crew, a new session and trace is created. If you want to manually manage sessions or traces, you can do this using by passing a Galileo logger instance to the listener.

To add the crew kickoff as a new trace to an existing session, create the session first using the logger instance that was used to create the listener:

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetCrewAINewSession/>
</CodeGroup>

To add the crew kickoff to an existing trace, ensure the trace is started, and set the `start_new_trace` parameter to `False`.
