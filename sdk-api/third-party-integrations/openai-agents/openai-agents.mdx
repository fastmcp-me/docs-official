The OpenAI Agents SDK uses has built in tracing to log agent runs, and this can be extended to log to platforms like Galileo. The Galileo Python SDK has a custom [OpenAI tracing processor](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/tracing/#custom-tracing-processors) that logs all agent events, allowing you to evaluate your agentic apps using Galileo metrics.

## Log an OpenAI Agent app

To log OpenAI Agent apps to Galileo, you need to create an instance of the [`GalileoTracingProcessor`](/sdk-api/python/reference/handlers/openai_agents#galileotracingprocessor-objects), and set this as the default tracing processor for your agent using the [`set_trace_processors`](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/tracing/#agents.tracing.set_trace_processors) function from the OpenAI Agents SDK.

Once this is set, all agent events, such as tool calls, handoffs, and generations, will be logged to Galileo.

By default the tracing processor using the current logger at the time it is created. For example, if you create this processor in a function that is decorated with the `@log` wrapper, then the processor will log to the same logger.

You can override this by passing a [GalileoLogger](/sdk-api/logging/galileo-logger) into the `GalileoTracingProcessor` constructor.
