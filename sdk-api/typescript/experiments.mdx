Galileo Experiments allow you to evaluate and improve your LLM applications by running tests against datasets and measuring performance using various metrics.

For a list of supported metrics, see the [Metrics Reference Guide](/concepts/metrics/metrics-reference).


## Run an Experiment with a Prompt Template

The simplest way to get started is by using a prompt template. 

* If you have an existing prompt template, you can fetch it by importing and using the [`getPromptTemplate`](/sdk-api/typescript/prompts#retrieving-a-prompt-template) function from the `galileo` SDK.
* In the `runExperiment` options below, `datasetName` expects a dataset that you created through either the [console](https://app.galileo.ai/datasets) or the [SDK](./datasets#creating-and-using-datasets). Ensure you have saved a dataset before running the experiment!

  <SnippetPromptTemplate />

## Run an Experiment with a Runner Function

For more complex scenarios, you can use a runner function. In this case, you may use either a [saved dataset](./datasets#creating-and-using-datasets) or a [custom one](#running-an-experiment-with-a-custom-dataset).

## Run an Experiment with a Custom Dataset

When you need to test specific scenarios:

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetCustomDataset />

For sophisticated evaluation needs:

  <SnippetCustomMetrics />
