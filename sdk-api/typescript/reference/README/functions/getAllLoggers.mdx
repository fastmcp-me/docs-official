# Function: getAllLoggers()

```ts
function getAllLoggers(): Map<string, GalileoLogger>;
```

Defined in: [src/singleton.ts](https://github.com/rungalileo/galileo-js/blob/main/src/singleton.ts)

Retrieve a shallow copy of the map containing all active loggers.

Returns a shallow copy of the map to prevent external modifications to the map structure.
This means:

- Adding or removing entries from the returned map will NOT affect the singleton's internal map
- However, the logger instances themselves are still references, so modifying logger properties
  (e.g., calling logger methods) will affect the actual loggers

The map keys are strings representing the logger identifier
(format: "project:identifier:mode"), and values are GalileoLogger instances.

## Returns

`Map`\<`string`, [`GalileoLogger`](/sdk-api/typescript/reference/README/classes/GalileoLogger)\>
