# OPENTELEMETRY & GALILEO IMPORTS
# ============================================================================
# OpenTelemetry (OTel) is an observability framework that helps you collect
# traces, metrics, and logs from your applications. Think of it as a way to
# "instrument" your code so you can see exactly what's happening during execution.

# Core OpenTelemetry imports
from opentelemetry.sdk import trace as trace_sdk  # SDK for creating traces
from opentelemetry import trace as trace_api  # API for interacting with traces
# Efficiently batches spans before export
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
# Sends traces via HTTP  
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
# Prints traces to console (for debugging)
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter

# OpenInference is a specialized instrumentation library that understands AI frameworks
# It automatically creates meaningful spans for LangChain/LangGraph operations
from openinference.instrumentation.langchain import LangChainInstrumentor
from openinference.instrumentation.openai import OpenAIInstrumentor

# LangGraph imports - this is what we're actually instrumenting
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

# OpenAI imports for LLM integration
import openai
```
