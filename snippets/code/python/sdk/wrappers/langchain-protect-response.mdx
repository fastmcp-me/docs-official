```python Python
# Invoke the chain
response = protected_chain.invoke({"input": query})

# Check the response type
if isinstance(response, str):
    # This indicates the ProtectTool intervened and returned a string directly
    # such as the random choice from an Override action
    print(f"🛡️ Intercepted/Modified - Protect Response: {response}")
else:
    # This means the LLM part of the chain was executed
    print(f"✅ Allowed - LLM Response: {response.content}")
```
