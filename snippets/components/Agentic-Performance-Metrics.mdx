| Name | Description | When to Use | Example Use Case |
|:-----|:------------|:------------|:-----------------|
| [Tool Error](/concepts/metrics/agentic/tool-error) | Detects errors or failures during the execution of tools. | When implementing AI agents that use tools and want to track error rates. | A coding assistant that uses external APIs to run code and must handle and report execution errors appropriately. |
| [Tool Selection Quality](/concepts/metrics/agentic/tool-selection-quality) | Evaluates whether the agent selected the most appropriate tools for the task. | When optimizing agent systems for effective tool usage. | A data analysis agent that must choose the right visualization or statistical method based on the data type and user question. |
| [Action Advancement](/concepts/metrics/agentic/action-advancement) | Measures how effectively each action advances toward the goal. | When assessing whether an agent is making meaningful progress in multi-step tasks. | A travel planning agent that needs to book flights, hotels, and activities in the correct sequence. |
| [Action Completion](/concepts/metrics/agentic/action-completion) | Determines whether the agent successfully accomplished all of the user's goals. | To assess whether an agent completed the desired goal. | A coding agent that is seeking to close engineering tickets. |
