The OTel endpoint is different from Galileo's regular API endpoint and is specifically designed to receive telemetry data in the OTLP format.

If you are using:

- **Galileo Cloud** at [app.galileo.ai](https://app.galileo.ai), then you don't need to provide a custom OTel endpoint.
The default endpoint `https://api.galileo.ai/otel/traces` will be used automatically.

- A **self-hosted Galileo deployment**, replace the `https://api.galileo.ai/otel/traces` endpoint with your deployment URL. The format of this URL is based on your console URL, replacing `console` with `api` and appending `/otel/traces`.

For example:

- if your console URL is `https://console.galileo.example.com`, the OTel endpoint would be `https://api.galileo.example.com/otel/traces`
- if your console URL is `https://console-galileo.apps.mycompany.com`, the OTel endpoint would be `https://api-galileo.apps.mycompany.com/otel/traces`
