Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), an Italian polymath, is regarded as the "father of modern physics" and "modern observational astronomy." His work was central to the Scientific Revolution.

### Contributions:

1. **Astronomy:** Improved telescopes; discovered Jupiter’s moons (1610), phases of Venus, and observed celestial details supporting heliocentrism.
2. **Physics:** Demonstrated uniform acceleration, inertia, and falling-body principles; studied pendulums and harmonic motion.
3. **Mathematics:** Applied mathematics to physics, developing concepts of acceleration and projectile motion.
4. **Scientific Method:** Advocated observation and experimentation over abstract reasoning.
5. **Church Conflict:** His defense of heliocentrism led to trial (1633) and house arrest.
6. **Legacy:** Advanced physics, astronomy, and scientific inquiry; became a symbol of science versus authority.
