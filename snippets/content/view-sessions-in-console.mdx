    <Step title="Log in to the Galileo Console and select your Log Stream">
        Head over to the [Galileo Console](https://app.galileo.ai) and log in.

        On your dashboard, select the Log Stream where you were sending your session logs. If you didn't specify a unique or new Log stream name, you will find the logs in your **default** Log Stream.

        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select your session">
        Selecting the Log stream will bring you to its event records. All logs will be grouped by *Session*, though you can use the control near the top-left of your screen to change the Log stream's event grouping:

        </Frame>

        Your session should be visible in the table below the controls, especially if you gave it a recognizable name. Select it to view the traces.
    </Step>

    <Step title="View your session">
        Once you select your session, you can see the Traces you captured from your test run as a flowchart. Any tools that were used will also show up as individual Spans. 

        Select the nodes of the flowchart to see their inputs and outputs on the right-edge of your screen.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Optional: View individual Spans">
        Each message from the user and response from the LLM will form a single trace; you can view the contents here in a familiar format, as well as other details like tool calls. Just select the **Messages** tab (shown in the image below) to see a list of traces in the session, along with their child spans. You can select a span to see metrics and other details on the right edge of the screen (not pictured)

        <InfoNote>Use the **Condense Steps** toggle to show only the most relevant spans in a trace. This will include any tool calls made by the LLM!</InfoNote>
