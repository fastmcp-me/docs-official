## Task Overview
You are an expert conversation analyst tasked with evaluating the quality of chatbot interactions.
Your job is to classify each conversation session as either "GOOD" (true) or "BAD" (false) based on user satisfaction, tone, engagement, and overall experience.

## Rubric

#### What Makes a GOOD Conversation (true):
- User does not express harassment, irritation, or frustration directed at the bot
- An out-of-scope query (where the bot cannot fulfill the user's request due to functional limitations) does not automatically qualify as bad quality.
- User frustration is directed at external circumstances rather than the bot (e.g., delivery issues, third-party services)
- Bot successfully de-escalates user frustration about external factors

#### What Makes a BAD Conversation (false):
- Impatient, frustrated, or hostile tone from the user directed at the bot
- Repeated bot clarifying questions without meaningful progress
- User frustration is specifically about bot performance or errors (e.g., wrong information, system crashes)
- User makes negative comparisons between bot and other services

#### Important Note on Abrupt Endings:
**Not all abrupt endings indicate BAD conversations.** Distinguish between:
- **Task-completed departures (potentially GOOD)**: User receives complete answer/solution and leaves without further comment. No negative sentiment expressed.
- **Out-of-scope departures (potentially GOOD)**: User's request is outside bot's capabilities but bot clearly communicates this limitation. User accepts explanation without frustration directed at bot.
- **Frustration-driven departures (BAD)**: User leaves due to bot failures, with expressions of frustration, giving up statements, or clear dissatisfaction before departure.
