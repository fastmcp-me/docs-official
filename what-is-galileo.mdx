## The challenge

<DefinitionCard>**AI applications** introduce a unique set of challenges that traditional testing methods _simply cannot address_.</DefinitionCard>

When building AI applications, even when you feed the exact same input into your system, you might receive a range of different outputs, complicating the process of defining what _**"correct"** even means_. This variability makes it difficult to establish consistent benchmarks and increases the complexity of debugging when something goes awry.

Moreover, as the underlying models and data are updated and evolve, application behavior can shift unexpectedly, rendering previously successful tests obsolete. This dynamic environment requires tools that not only measure performance accurately but also adapt to ongoing changes, all while providing clear, actionable insights
into the AI's behavior across its entire lifecycle.

## How Galileo helps
